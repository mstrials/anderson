# Trial Task — Membership Plan Carousel + Contact Form

## Goal
Build a **data-driven, reusable** membership plan UI (based on the provided screenshots in /public/screens) that cycles through plans in a **carousel** on **/plans**, and also build a **/contact** page containing a contact form.

This task is focused on:
- Component design
- Reusability
- State management
- Clean UI implementation

---

## Tech assumptions
- React (or Next.js) + TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind for styling
- Pixel-perfect accuracy is not required, but layout should reasonably match the screenshot.

---

## Provided data (single source of truth)

Use this array to render plan names and prices. This must be the only source of pricing data. 

> It has been provided in /data/products.ts

```ts
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  monthlyPrice: number;
  totalMonthlyPrice: number;
  totalMonthlySavings: number;
  totalAnnualPrice: number;
}

export const products: Product[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Bronze Membership',
    monthlyPrice: 140,
    totalMonthlyPrice: 1680,
    totalMonthlySavings: 420,
    totalAnnualPrice: 2140,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Silver Membership',
    monthlyPrice: 240,
    totalMonthlyPrice: 2880,
    totalMonthlySavings: 3420,
    totalAnnualPrice: 540,
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'Gold Membership',
    monthlyPrice: 340,
    totalMonthlyPrice: 3680,
    totalMonthlySavings: 820,
    totalAnnualPrice: 6820,
  },
];
```

# Part A — Membership Plans Carousel

## Core requirement

Build a carousel that displays **one plan at a time** and allows switching between plans using **left/right navigation arrows** (like the screenshot).

The carousel must be:

- **Data-driven**
- **Reusable**
- Generated by mapping over the `products` array
- **Not hardcoded** to exactly 3 slides

---

## Reusable component API

Create a reusable component similar to:



Where:

- `products` is an array of `Product`
- The component maps over `products` to generate slides
- The component should work for **any length** of products

---

## Data → UI mapping (must follow exactly)

These values must come from the `Product` fields (not hardcoded) and must be formatted as currency.

| UI Element                         | Data field                     |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Top header title                  | `product.name`                |
| Main price on the right           | `product.monthlyPrice`        |
| Monthly option “Annual Cost”      | `product.totalMonthlyPrice`   |
| Annual option “Annual Cost”       | `product.totalAnnualPrice`    |
| “Your Savings”                    | `product.totalMonthlySavings` |

### Example for Silver

- `$240.00*` → `monthlyPrice`  
- `$2,880.00` → `totalMonthlyPrice`  
- `$3,420.00` → `totalAnnualPrice`  
- `$540.00` → `totalMonthlySavings`

---

## UI structure per slide

Each slide should visually follow the screenshot.

### Left column — Membership Information

- Header: **“Membership Information”**
- Row of 3 icons + labels (static content is fine)
- Feature list with green check / red cross icons (static content is fine)

> This feature list does **not** need to come from data and can be hardcoded once.

---

### Right column — Payment Information

- Header: **“Payment Information”**
- Large price text showing `product.monthlyPrice`
- Two static contact buttons:
  - “Speak To Our Team”
  - “Chat With Our Team”
- “Select a payment option below” section:
  - Monthly Fee and Annual Fee selectable options
  - “Annual Cost” row showing both totals
  - “Your Savings” row
  - “12-Month Contract” row (static icons are fine)
- “Purchase Membership” button (no backend logic required)

---

## Payment option selection behavior

- Implement UI state for **Monthly vs Annual**
- Selected option must be visually highlighted
- This is **UI-only** — no payment logic required

---

## Currency formatting

All money values must:

- Include dollar sign
- Include comma separators
- Always show 2 decimals

### Examples

- `240` → `$240.00`  
- `2880` → `$2,880.00`

---

# Part B — Contact Page (`/contact`)

## Requirement

Create a route at **`/contact`** that renders a contact form.

---

## Form fields (minimum)

- Full name (required)
- Email (required, basic email validation)
- Phone (optional)
- Subject (required)
- Message (required, textarea)

---

## UX requirements

- Inline validation messages (or clear error state)
- Disable submit button while submitting
- On successful submit:
  - Show success message
  - Reset form

---

## Submission handling

No real integration required. Use one of:

### Option 1 (preferred)

Submit to a simple internal API route or handler that:

- Waits ~1 second
- Returns success

### Option 2

Simulate submit using `setTimeout` and local state.

---

## Styling

- Clean, modern layout
- Mobile-friendly (single column)
- Focus/hover states on inputs and button

---

# Deliverables

- Reusable carousel component using `products` data
- Membership plans page that uses the carousel
- `/contact` page with form, validation, and success state
- README notes explaining:
  - How to run the project
  - Where main components live

---
